The current state of support for switch chips in Linux is not good. Each vendor provides userspace binary sdk blob that only works with their chips. Each of this blobs has proprietary APIs. To get switch chips properly supported there's need to introduce a new infrastructure directly into Linux kernel and to work with vendors to adopt it.This talk presents the current effort to unify and uphold the Linux networking model across the spectrum of devices which is necessary to make Linux the cornerstone of industrial grade networking. The scope of this talk covers state of art with current implementation of standard commodity switches such as top of rack switches, small home gateway device as well as SR-IOV NIC embedded switches.

One of the general problem we face is: Where to get a 3D model to print? Most of us are good coders, but lousy designers. Let's face it. Trying to produce some content in Blender drives me crazy and it usually ends up as crap. That's where OpenSCAD comes in handy. Quote from the OpenSCAD website [1]:  \"OpenSCAD is not an interactive modeller. Instead it is something like a 3D-compiler that reads in a script file that describes the object and renders the 3D model from this script file. This gives you (the designer) full control over the modelling process and enables you to easily change any step in the modelling process or make designs that are defined by configurable parameters.\"  In this workshop I'll teach you how to use OpenSCAD and how to create useful parametric 3D models designed mostly for 3D printing.Come with OpenSCAD pre-installed. On Fedora, that means installing theopenscad package (openscad-MCAD can be installed as well). On otherplatforms, see&nbsp;http:\/\/www.openscad.org\/downloads.html&nbsp;- also note thatwe will use OpenSCAD 2014.03.

As a result, the last year or so has seen many NoSQL implementations adopt transactions in one way or another.

The existing Linux kernel features are often not enough for this task and projects like OpenStack use the existing features to their very limits, sometimes even over them. New projects have been started to deal with this; a most prominent example is Open vSwitch. However, despite the quick pace of development, there is still lack of needed features on the kernel part. This leads to creative usage of combinations of the currently offered kernel features, leading to very complex undebuggable configurations. If you log in to such machine, you find tens of virtual interfaces and name spaces with strange non-obvious relationships between them.  The talk will present a few possible ways to get out of this. A new tool, plotnetcfg, that allows easier overview of the network relationship will be shown. The workarounds that are deployed by cloud platforms (as seen in the wild) will be explained and corresponding missing features in the kernel will be identified. How to implement them is in many cases an open problem; some possible solutions will be discussed. Interestingly, Open vSwitch may not be an answer for everything.","tags":["Networking & SDN"],"location":"","lang":"EN","hash":"3aec648e9a89e58625386504119fd3ffdc8135f9"},{"type":"Talk","event_start":1423222200,"event_start_rfc":"Fri, 06 Feb 2015 12:30:00 +0100","event_end":1423227600,"event_end_rfc":"Fri, 06 Feb 2015 14:00:00 +0100","room":"Workshops \u2013 E105","room_short":"E105","room_color":"#ff9999","topic":"DevAssistant Workshop \u2013 modern tool for developers","speakers":["Tomas Radej"],"description":"DevAssistant, the universal tool for kickstarting your development, has received a ton of new features in the latest couple of releases.

But what it means to deploy it on the server? What is needed to keep your domain secured? There are a lot of manual and semi-automated tasks administrators need to do. This is where FreeIPA steps in and makes the deployment and maintenance of DNSSEC signed zone easy as few clicks in Web UI. Once you deployed DNSSEC on the server side, there is still some work to have your clients secured, too. Especially when using public hot-spots and networks, you should use secured DNS to eliminate man-in-the-middle attacks.  In the lab we will briefly explain how DNSSEC works. Afterwards we will deploy a signed zone using only BIND and also BIND + FreeIPA combination. We will show how FreeIPA can ease your pain with DNSSEC deployment. In the end we will try out the DNSSEC from client side using dnssec-trigger and unbound server, to keep you secured at all times.

Hence, the following mantra is central to the PCP architecture: 'If it is important for monitoring system performance, and you can measure it, you can easily integrate it into the PCP framework'.

It also has a much lower overhead as it doesn't use the ptrace syscall. Support for tracing page faults and other events, as well as provide callchains leading to a syscall and other traced events are being planned and may even be ready by devconf'15 time!

Testing accounts for a large portion of the cost of software development. Tools to automate testing allow for more thorough testing in less time. Property-based testing provides ways to define expected properties of functions under test and mechanisms to automatically check whether those properties hold in a large number of cases - or whether a property can be falsified.  Concepts will be demonstrated primarily in Haskell, using the QuickCheck library. Property-based testing is available in most languages, so options for Python and Java will also be examined. The talk will conclude with a discussion of the limitations of property-based testing, and alternative approaches.

In this talk we will explore what other features perf provides: Besides simply checking where the CPU spends most of its cycles, one can easily add custom tracepoints and capture arguments or return values from functions. We will do so on examples in the networking stack. This will be useful to isolate bugs or even validate patches.  In an outlook the talk will introduce the audience what performance counters are available on today's CPUs but not easily accessible in perf. A short introduction will be given on how the register and masks are to be interpreted from the CPU manuals and how they can be used from perf.
