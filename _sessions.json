Mutation testing takes this notion a step further and offers a deep down investigation (through code modification or removal) of the impact each line of production code makes on the whole test.

It also allows for decoupling of metric recording and its analysis. What's more, Thermostat supports remote monitoring and instrumentation of the system which is hosting your Java application while keeping the extra overhead minimal. In short, it can provide an inside perspective of what's happening inside your OpenJDK JVM while it's executing your application.<br \/><br \/>In this session we'll show some of Thermostat's out-of-the-box-features and we will conclude with a hands-on workshop developing a simple Thermostat plug-in.
