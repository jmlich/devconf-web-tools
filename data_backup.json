Our starting point is the network card driver as it feeds a packet into the stack. We will follow the packet as it traverses through various subsystems such as packet filtering, routing, protocol stacks, and the socket layer. We will pause here and there to look into concepts such as segmentation offloading, TCP small queues, and low latency polling. We will cover APIs exposed by the kernel that go beyond use of write()\/read() on sockets and will look into how they are implemented on the kernel side.","tags":["Networking"],"location":"MUNI","lang":"EN"},{"type":"talk","event_start":1391763000,"event_start_rfc":"Fri, 07 Feb 2014 09:50:00 +0100","event_end":1391765400,"event_end_rfc":"Fri, 07 Feb 2014 10:30:00 +0100","room":"Lecture room D2","room_short":"D2","room_color":"#fcaf3e","topic":"Wake me up!

Users expect more out of web interfaces, and more is being asked of web developers to meet those expectations.  As a result we are finding more and more javascript present into our web applicationsBest practices however still apply, and suggest that we encapsulate our client-side code to avoid repetition (stay DRY), allow for code reuse, and to improve the testability of our applications.  JQuery plugins are the de-facto standard providing the mechanism for such encapsulation.  The jQuery UI widget factory provides us with a mechanism for developing stateful jQuery plugins; defining a plugin lifecycle allows for the removal of much boilerplate code.In this session we will look at developing jQuery plugins using the jQuery UI widget factory.  With a focus on creating visual plugins (widgets), we will explore the widget factory lifecycle, discuss best practices in widget development, and explore some of the pitfalls of developing stateful widgets.

Various attempts have been made to build such a system on top of the available primitives, the most important and successful project being D-Bus. D-Bus brought standardization and introspectability however being designed for exchanging control messages only, brings serious performance issues when it is used to deliver payload.In this talk we'll discuss \"kdbus\", our attempt to move D-Bus into the kernel layer, to make it truly universal, and how it is integrated into systemd and its APIs. kdbus brings scalabale, secure, high performance IPC on the kernel level, while staying compatible with classic D-Bus in most ways. From the beginning it has been designed to provide single-copy and zero-copy communication, and namespacing and sandboxing has been designed into it from the beginning.When designing \"kdbus\" we took a lot of inspiration from IPC systems in the Operating Systems, including most importantly Android Binder, Mach Ports, Solaris Doors, and QNX IPC, which we will cover in this talk too.","tags":["Kernel, Userspace"],"location":"MUNI","lang":"EN"},{"type":"talk","event_start":1391852400,"event_start_rfc":"Sat, 08 Feb 2014 10:40:00 +0100","event_end":1391854800,"event_end_rfc":"Sat, 08 Feb 2014 11:20:00 +0100","room":"Lecture room D3","room_short":"D3","room_color":"#8ae234","topic":"The Kotlin Programming Language","speakers":["Ladislav Thon"],"description":"A lot of people in the Java community has been long longing for some kind of a \"Java.next\" language, a language that will be modern yet keep the design spirit.

This approach has been known for over 30 years circling mainly within academic communities and only recently has it been rediscovered and introduced to the benefit of commercial solutions. Mutation testing technique which focuses on partitioning the code on per line basis with regards to influence on the logic put under test provides actual (as opposed to artificial and synthetic) view on tests quality.The presentation will provide solutions and answers to the following:- What is mutation testing?- Why use it?- Limitations and drawbacks- Why only now does it start to get traction?- How to prepare your project for mutation testing?- Is there a case for it in the enterprise?This presentation is meant for software development-involved individuals who want to learn more about mutation testing, what advantages over traditional coverage scheme it offers and how to apply the idea to their existing codebase.

Debian Infrastructure has adopted it as well laying the basis for a&nbsp;multi-distro realtime message bus.In this presentation, I'll give an overview of fedmsg -- the Federated Message&nbsp;Bus -- what it is, how it works, and why some design decisions were made the&nbsp;way they were.

You can show up at our weekly IRC meeting and get \"fi-apprentice\" rights to log in to machines. - Signed, but unencrypted.  Anyone can read, anyone can write.  Only some messages are trusted.  Key here is that anyone can debug at any point in our infrastructure. - No central broker.  Datacenters are donated and distributed.  Things can go down.  fedmsg designed to not bring *anything* down with it. - Public zmq.PUB socket.  The world can read at ``tcp:\/\/hub.fedoraproject.org:9940`` -- point a ``zmq.SUB`` socket at it with ``recv_multipart``.- CLI tools and API examples - CLI: ``echo \"hello world\" | fedmsg-logger`` - CLI: ``fedmsg-tail --really-pretty`` - API: ``fedmsg.publish(...)`` - API: ``fedmsg.tail_messages(...)``- Applications built against fedmsg - fedmsg-notifications. -- Problem: all of our applications carry their own email code. With that comes further baggage and maintenance. With fedmsg notifications for interesting infrastructure events, we can put all that code in one place where it can be more easily maintained. Benefit to the end-user: manage notification preferences in one place instead of per-app. Opens up notifications to different contexts:  Email? IRC privmsg? Android? RSS? - Push to test\/qa infrastructure. When new packages are built, we can instantly run depchain analysis tests.  This is was done previously with cronjobs. When new composes are complete, we can fire off jobs in beaker to make sure install and integration tests pass.  This was done previously by hand. - Push notifications to mirrors Over 200 mirrors right now.  They have cronjobs that poll with rsync, we can use ``fedmsg-trigger`` to fire off rsync only when the compose notification is published. - Sync apprentice and packager credentials Ugly cronjobs exist that run that sync shell groups to machines from the Fedora Account System.  With ``fedmsg-trigger``, we fire off an ansible playbook to sync creds when group-membership-change messages are published. Same goes for package ownership and ACL changes.  People had to wait up to an hour for their creds to propagate. - Visualizations - Faking git logs for \"gource\". Run \"fedmsg-tail --gource | gource -i 0 --log-format custom -\" to get the realtime version of [this](http:\/\/threebean.org\/so-i-turned-the-fedmsg-data-into-a-git-log-and.webm). Its the best office dashboard ever. - Reports - fedora-news, this-week-in-fedora, owner-change-tool, &amp; release engineering dashboard. HTML5 dashboards that query the history of fedmsg to make useful reports. http:\/\/ambre.pingoured.fr\/fedora-news\/ http:\/\/ambre.pingoured.fr\/thisweekinfedora\/ https:\/\/lists.fedoraproject.org\/pipermail\/infrastructure\/2013-June\/013070.html https:\/\/apps.stg.fedoraproject.org\/releng-dash\/ - Fedora Badges for distro contributors https:\/\/badges.fedoraproject.org Backends listens to the bus and wakes up in response to new events. Compares messages against a series of 100 or so rules defined in YAML.  If a contributor matches some criteria, then they are awarded a badge (achievement unlocked!) Fun fact -- this is hooked into Mozilla's Open Badges Infrastructure (OBI).  https:\/\/openbadges.org\/- Debian adoption - Imagine a multi-distro realtime development pony - This is amazing.  Their bus is still coming up but they have a ton of message types already passing over it. - They too have a publicly subscribable endpoint.  Your end user machine can subscribe to *both* the Fedora and the Debian buses. - Imagine this scenario:  a security bug gets filed in Debian.  A Fedora daemon listens to their bus and automatically files the same bug on our tracker against the same package (perhaps it is smart and checks for dupes first). - A new package update is marked as a security fix in Fedora, a debian daemon listens and tries to check if the same patch is applied there.  If not, it emails the maintainer to find out whats up. - We just started talking about a Holy Grail - integrating compatible semantic DOAP and FOAF information with all messages so we can easily correlate activity between the distributions. - Can we provide a service to upstreams?  Aim your github service hook at some bucket service.  When you tag a new release, it notifies the upstream-bucket, the upstream-bucket notifies anyone who wants to know (Fedora, Debian, &amp; friends).","tags":["Fedora"],"location":"MUNI","lang":"EN"},{"type":"talk","event_start":1391935800,"event_start_rfc":"Sun, 09 Feb 2014 09:50:00 +0100","event_end":1391938200,"event_end_rfc":"Sun, 09 Feb 2014 10:30:00 +0100","room":"Lecture room D2","room_short":"D2","room_color":"#fcaf3e","topic":"We are Fedora (and so can you)!","speakers":["Stephen Gallagher"],"description":"The Fedora Project is embarking on an exciting new vision of the future.
